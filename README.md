jekyll-midnight
===============

A theme for the [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) static blog generator.

jekyll-midnight was directly ported from the [Github Pages Midnight theme](https://github.com/mattgraham/Midnight)
by [Matt Graham](https://github.com/mattgraham) using the [Twitter-2.0 theme](https://github.com/gdagley/theme-twitter-2.0)
 as a template.

I've taken the Midnight theme and bastardised it somewhat to match the monokai
 colourscheme, as I prefer those to the originals.

Installation
------------

    rake theme:install git="https://github.com/Sam2304/jekyll-monokai"
